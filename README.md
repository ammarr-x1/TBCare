# TB Care — Intelligent Tuberculosis Management Platform  
**Final Year Project (FYP)**

## Overview
**TB Care** is a data-driven healthcare platform designed to support **tuberculosis monitoring, management, and decision-making** through centralized digital dashboards.

The current implementation focuses on **web-based dashboards** that provide structured visibility into patient data, screening outcomes, and system-level insights—laying a solid foundation for a scalable, end-to-end TB care ecosystem.

---

## Problem Statement
TB management workflows are often fragmented, manual, and slow, limiting visibility for healthcare providers and delaying critical interventions. There is a need for a **centralized, intelligent system** that enables structured tracking and informed decision-making.

## Current Capabilities (Web Dashboards)

### Administrative & Clinical Dashboards
- Centralized view of TB-related data  
- Structured visualization of screening and patient information  
- Role-oriented insights for healthcare staff  

### Data Organization & Tracking
- Patient records and case summaries  
- Screening and diagnostic status tracking  
- Clear separation of operational and analytical views  

### Decision Support
- Actionable visual insights for clinicians  
- Data clarity to support early intervention and follow-ups  

---

## System Scope
> **Current Phase:** Web dashboards only  
> **Planned Expansion:** Mobile apps, ML-driven screening, and full patient lifecycle management

The architecture is intentionally designed to support future integration without refactoring core components.
